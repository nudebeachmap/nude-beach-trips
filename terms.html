      Unless otherwise stated on an individual trip page, the following cancellation policy applies. Cancellation timelines

    </p>

    <h2>3. Trip Cancellations by Us</h2>
    <p>
      If a trip is cancelled by us due to operational, safety, or unforeseen circumstances, participants will receive a
      <strong>full refund of all amounts paid</strong>, including deposits.
